This will be a simple word adventure game that I want to make with Ruby. I am not sure where it will go but something that I have not done since high school-16 years ago! 

So far I have added conditional statements to it that allow the user to make choices, a voice feature where it speaks to you at times and finally an array system to collect items along your journey!

In many ways, this game is simply a choose your own adventure type of game. Those books were something that I enjoyed reading when I was a little kid.
