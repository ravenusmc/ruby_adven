This will be a simple word adventure game that I want to make with Ruby. I am not sure where it will go but something that I have not done since high school-16 years ago! 

So far I have added conditional statements to it that allow the user to make choices, a voice feature where it speaks to you at times and finally an array system to collect items along your journey!

In many ways, this game is simply a choose your own adventure type of game. Those books were something that I enjoyed reading when I was a little kid. 

I have also included three other programs. The first, game.rb, will be one that will allow a user to input video games that they have. The second, bank.rb, is a program that I wrote for my computer science class. I wanted to reveiw ruby as well as do the assignment! The final program will be a tic tac toe board that I may add to over time. Enjoy!

Okay, I did not want to do this but added one more file for programs that I solve in my classes. I think that they are a great exercise for me to stay up to date with ruby.
